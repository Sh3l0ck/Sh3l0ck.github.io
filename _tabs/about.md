I'm **Sh3l0ck**, a cyber warrior obsessed with the adrenaline rush of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and the intricate puzzles of Hack The Box (HTB). My days are filled with cracking the toughest challenges, hunting for exploits, and leaving no stone unturned in the cyber realm. From top finishes at DEFCON qualifiers to owning over 100 HTB boxes, I'm always pushing the limits of what's possible. Welcome to my world of digital conquest!
