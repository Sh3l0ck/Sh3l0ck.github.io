## OSI Challenge

Iris and her assistant are away on vacation. She left an audio message explaining how to get in touch with her assistant. See what you can learn about the assistant.

Transcript: Hello, you’ve reached Iris Stein, head of the HR department! I’m currently away on vacation, please contact my assistant Michel. You can reach out to him at michelangelocorning0490@gmail.com. Have a good day and take care.

# Solution

One of the easier OSI challenges

First I just extracted the file from the away-on-vacation.tar.gz file

I got a mp3 file i ran it and listened to what appears to be an automated message requesting me to contact Michelangelo Corning and i was given an email address that proved useless so I did a simple search on bing for him to get an instagram account in his name

Opened up his instagram file to find the flag on one of his posts
