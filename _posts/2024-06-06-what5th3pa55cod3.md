# Challenge 

After we used Kuki's birthday to unlock a phone in his place, we found a `mysecret.apk` in the phone, but it needs a passcode to view the secret.

Flag format: SKR{flag}

Note: Download the qrcode.png to scan and download using an Android device

**Difficulty:** Medium

# Solution

First, to begin, I downloaded `mysecret.apk` ([mysecret apk](/assets/img/What5Th3Pa55Cod3/mysecret.apk)) on my laptop and used the QR code to download `mysecret.apk`  on my phone:

![mysecret qr code](https://skrctf.me/files/e3e75d860ef017739becf0793f3a757c/qrcode.png)

After this, to analyze the apk file, use whatever tool you are comfortable with. Personally, I am more familiar with JADX-GUI.

After snooping around for a while, I found the `com` folder. A weird fact, but a lot of times the main source code for applications is stored in a master folder 'com'. So from in there, starting off at the 'MainActivity' folder, which I assume must run first, I just followed the code.

I follow the code through which I obtain the passcode and the date of birth. You can find it yourself just by reading through the code.

And finally, I obtain the flag.
